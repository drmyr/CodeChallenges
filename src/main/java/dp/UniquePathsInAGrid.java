     *
     * Given a grid of size m * n, let us assume you are starting at (1, 1) and your goal is to reach (m, n).
     * At any instance, if you are on (x, y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).
     * Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
     * An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * Input: [[0, 0, 0],
     *         [0, 1, 0],
     *         [0, 0, 0]]
     * Output : 2
     * There is only one obstacle in the middle.
     * @param obstacleGrid
     * @return
